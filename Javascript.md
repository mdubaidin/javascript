# Javascript

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm scripting language that supports several programming styles, including:

-   **Object-oriented programming:** Code is divided into classes, and typically supports inheritance and polymorphism.
-   **Functional programming:** The language itself heavily controls state changes on the computer.
-   **Imperative programming:** Includes procedural programming and object-oriented programming.
